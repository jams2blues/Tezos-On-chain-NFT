Zero Contract
Zero reliance on off-chanin storage for our Tezos Art
Also a plan on my name.

This smart contract has been writen to provide a simple way to mint on-chain artwork with the Tezos blockchain.
It is written in the Legacy SmartPy programming language speicifally for use with the legacy.smartpy.io/ide compiler.

IMPORTANT: On-chain artwork is saved with a datarUri format in the "artifactUri" metadata attribute.
Objkt.com currently does not recognize artifactUri strings longer than 254 characters.
Any token exceeding this limitation needs to contact Objkt.com directly and request the limitation be removed for their collection.

Attribution appreciated but not required. Either way, if you end up using this contract I would love to hear about it.
I look forward to seeing the growth of Tezos on-chain art.
